## FAQ

I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following my github repo, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on my github content!

Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
